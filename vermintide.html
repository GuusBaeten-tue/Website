      Inspiration: Vermintide, Darkest Dungeon<br>
      System: pf2e<br>
      Why: players must be able to take it slow, have high AC to defend against hordes, attrition/survival is more important dan pushing on.<br>
      <br>
      Gameplay loop: incursion style. Go in, achieve an objective, get out. The objective could be to obtain an object, destroy something, save something. Plenty of options. Players are an elite type team that is sent to turn the tide.<br>
      A central return point is good. This saves me from building a world and limits it to missions.<br>
      Players may be able to choose missions against different factions; the Skaven, Chaos warriors, the Green Horde.
